#Things that have happened already

1. Add draught horses and have them spawn at farms - 1x chance 30 per farm Size for draught horses based on a Shire Horse stallion: 

Size 1000kg, average top speed 35MPH, roughly same as a Standardbred

Changes: 550 kg to 1000 kg, volume 550k to 1000k, carry ratio from 20% to 25%.

Google suggests, among others, that "The average top speed of a horse is 25 to 30 mph," implying some draught horses can be faster than average.

Thus, leaving speed unchanged for now seems reasonable, especially considering how horses have been made unsuitable for combat.

#Things that will probably never happen

2. Training regimen for regular horses and draught horses into the appropriate war horse type

3. Expanded war horse behaviour: assisting in combat, going home, coming when whistled for
