# Purpose
Expand on horses

#Things that have happened already
1. Add draught horses and have them spawn at farms - 1x 66% chance per farm
1b. Stats for draught horses based on average Shire Horse stallion.
Size 1000kg, average top speed 35MPH, roughly same as a Standardbred
Changes: 550 kg to 1000 kg. hp 90 to 164 (based on weight), volume 550k to 1000k
Melee dice from 2 to 3  
Speed unchanged on the assumption the default horse may well be a Standardbred.
Google suggests, among others, that "The average top speed of a horse is 25 to 30 mph," which would mean at least some draught horses can be faster than average. Thus, leaving speed unchanged for now seems reasonable.
Lastly, bump up horse carrying from 20% to 25% based on research paper suggesting strain is actually not observed in a horse until 25%.

#Things that will probably never happen
2. Training regimen for regular horses and draught horses into the appropriate war horse type
3. Expanded war horse behaviour: assisting in combat, going home, coming when whistled for
